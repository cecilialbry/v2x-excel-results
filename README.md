# 📊 V2X Scenario Results – Excel Tables

This repository contains preliminary and organized results of energy flexibility scenarios related to V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) use cases, studied during my internship at the LUCAMI Laboratory (University of Ljubljana, April–July 2025).

---

## 📘 Overview

The goal of the project is to assess, compare, and rank the most relevant V2X use cases based on various technical, energy, and economic criteria. These cases include:  
- **V2H** (Vehicle-to-Home)  
- **V2B** (Vehicle-to-Building)  
- **V2G** (Vehicle-to-Grid)  
- as well as **shared and public transport applications**

## 🧩 Included Files

### 🔹 `regroupement de tous les UC.xlsx`

This file gathers all the **use cases (UCs)** studied, grouped by country and type. It serves as a key working base providing a **broad overview** of the possible scenarios to simulate.

This file was used to:  
✔️ list all realistic cases to be considered  
✔️ cross-reference season, day, use case, strategy, and country  
✔️ structure the scenarios based on the EV4EU project needs

### 🔹 `resultats trouvés par calculs.xlsx`

This spreadsheet contains **preliminary results manually calculated** using formulas from scientific articles. These formulas were applied by hand to estimate key indicators such as:

- available flexibility (in kWh or %)
- energy exchanged (charged/discharged)
- economic savings
- local energy autonomy

This preliminary work helped test the validity of the assumptions, validate the simulation methodology, and build an initial evaluation framework for the use cases.

## 🧮 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is intended to:
- Centralize initial data before automatic simulation
- Document assumptions and manual results
- Provide a basis for Python-simulated scenarios
- Share the methodological framework of the project
